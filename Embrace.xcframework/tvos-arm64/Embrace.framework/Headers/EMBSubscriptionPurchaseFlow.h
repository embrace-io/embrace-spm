/**
 Starts a subscription purchase moment.

 This method should be called as soon as the user indicates an intent to purchase a subscription. This means that
 all information pertaining to the purchase (e.g. billing, payment, shipping) should already be known prior to
 invoking this method.

 @param orderId The ID that represents the subscription purchase order. This value is optional and, if present, will
                associate the value as a property of the moment.
 @param subscriptionType The recurrence factor (e.g. monthly, annual) of the subscription purchase. This value is
                         optional and, if present, will associate the value as a property of the moment.
 @param amount The total amount of the subscription purchase. This value is optional and, if present, will associate
               the value as a property of the moment.
 @param paymentType The payment system that will be fulfilling the subscription purchase (e.g. Google IAB, PayPal,
                    BrainTree). This value is optional and, if present, will associate the value as a property of
                    the moment.
 @param properties A map of Strings to Objects that represent additional properties to associate with the moment.
                   This value is optional. A maximum of 10 properties (not including the ones set via arguments to
                   this method) may be set.

 @return True if the operation was successful; false otherwise.
